## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Player WebSocket reader/writer goroutines: full bidirectional message handling with context-based coordination, envelope validation, and game error propagation
- Session termination on snapshot marshal failure: when a game adapter produces unmarshalable state after a successful action, the session terminates cleanly with `internal_error` rather than continuing in an unplayable state
- WebSocket upgrade endpoints for player (`/sessions/{id}/ws`) and observer (`/sessions/{id}/ws/observe`) connections
- HTTP session handlers: `POST /sessions`, `GET /sessions`, `GET /sessions/{id}`, `PATCH /sessions/{id}`, `POST /sessions/{id}/start`, `DELETE /sessions/{id}`
- Bearer token authentication on player WebSocket upgrades
- WebSocket message size limit (64 KB default, configurable via `WSReadLimit`)
- Nil-safe snapshot handling throughout the session layer
- Marshal-failure defense: sessions skip empty snapshots rather than sending nil frames to WebSocket clients
